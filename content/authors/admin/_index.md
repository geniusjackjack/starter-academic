I am a senior majoring in psychology at UC Davis—where I work as an assistant lab manager and research assistant in the Personality & Self-Knowledge Lab headed by Dr. Simine Vazire. Independently and as an RA, I research topics related to personality and metascience. To prepare for a career as a scientist-practitioner I am currently an applicant to doctoral programs in industrial-organizational psychology for Fall 2021. My research interests within I-O include the impact of individual difference traits on workplace outcomes, work-life balance, and measurement validation.
